## Approaches to Lectures & Demos 

- A bit of theory on certain new topics 
- Examples and case-studies from the readings 
- Review / demonstration of particular GIS analysis or software skills on as-needed basis 
- Compared to the other GIS courses, there will be much more time to work on lab assignments during scheduled class time 

## Readings

- Several required readings for each topic - most are journal articles 
- Most of the readings are closely related to the lab assignments - we can't cover all the advanced techniques from the literature, but doing the readings will help with the lab assignments, in particular answering the questions 
- Some readings use very advanced statistical methods or other non-GIS techniques - don't worry, you don't have to understand the nuts and bolts of each method - focus on the GIS elements

## Expected Knowledge: ArcGIS 

* Knowledge of the fundamentals of ArcGIS is required 
    - support will be provided by the instructor on a as needed basis. 
    - You will be given course codes for online ESRI Virtual Campus courses. 
* A basic knowledge of Spatial Analyst is required -we'll do more advanced stuff throughout this course.
