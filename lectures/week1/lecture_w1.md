    -   3D data creation, visualization, analysis
    -   Lidar data management, editing, and analysis

Approaches to Lectures & Demos
------------------------------

-   A bit of theory on certain new topics
-   Examples and case-studies from the readings
-   Review / demonstration of particular GIS analysis or software skills on as-needed basis
-   Compared to the other GIS courses, there will be much more time to work on lab assignments during scheduled class time

Readings
--------

-   Several required readings for each topic - most are journal articles
-   Most of the readings are closely related to the lab assignments - we can't cover all the advanced techniques from the literature, but doing the readings will help with the lab assignments, in particular answering the questions
-   Some readings use very advanced statistical methods or other non-GIS techniques - don't worry, you don't have to understand the nuts and bolts of each method - focus on the GIS elements

Expected Knowledge: ArcGIS
--------------------------

-   Knowledge of the fundamentals of ArcGIS is required
    -   support will be provided by the instructor on a as needed basis.
    -   You will be given course codes for online ESRI Virtual Campus courses.
-   A basic knowledge of Spatial Analyst is required -we'll do more advanced stuff throughout this course.

Expected Knowledge: Vector and Raster Analysis Tools
