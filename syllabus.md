## Course philosophy and goals

Geography 489 is to demonstrate the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to aid in environmental modeling, management and planning.  Specifically, the course will teach students necessary spatial and quantitative analysis methods to solve problems in urban planning, natural resource management, watershed management, and sustainability evaluation.  Using examples and case studies from the readings, this course is designed to build confidence and familiarity in students with the use of GIS technology in a wide range of environmental and social issues. The specific learning outcomes are:
* 	To get a good understanding of the use of GIS in a wide range of social and environmental issues;
* 	To become familiar with the use of selected environmental models combined with GIS;
* 	To practice the use of advanced GIS techniques;
* 	To obtain in-depth knowledge of a selected topic through an independent project.

## Prerequisite 
GEOG388 (former GEOG488) or equivalent GIS knowledge and skills.  More detailed expected knowledge is described in the lecture slides.

## Course materials
Weekly required readings (most from journals) will be posted on the laulima website. **Do the readings before lectures!!!**

Optional reference books (not required, use them if you want to learn more than covered in the class):

* *Kanevski, M.F., and M. Maignan. 2004. Analysis and Modelling of Spatial Environmental Data. EPFL Press, Distributed by Marcel Dekker, Inc. ISBN: 0824759818. (focus on Geostatistics)*

* *Michael N. DeMers, 2009 Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. ISBN: 978-0-470-12906-7 (required textbook)*

### Course lab work
Labs will be introduced in class and explanation will be given to accomplish the tasks.  Time will be allotted in class to work on the labs.  If more time is needed, they can be finished after class.  The teaching assistant will collect and grade the labs, **which will be due two weeks later after lab is started.  Labs up to 1 week late are penalized 20%. Labs more than 1 week late are penalized 100%.**

Please note you may work together on labs, but you each must do every part of each lab, and **turn in entirely your own work**.  That means each of you should perform every step indicated in the lab manual. **Your grade is for individual effort; copied files/maps from other students will be construed as cheating, at a minimum you’ll get zero for the lab, and you may automatically fail the course.**

All labs will be done in computer. We will set up an account for every student in the computer lab. The software to be used is **ArcGIS 10, its extensions (such as spatial analyst and 3D analyst), and some open-source packages (e.g. GDAL) for specific applications.**

Students need to submit lab reports for each lab. The lab report should be in **Microsoft Word** or **PDF** file format and submitted to Laulima. Lab instructions will contain numbered questions to be answered and very specific deliverables in terms of maps, tables and graphs.

### Course Project
For the course project topics, you can select from a set of suggested projects, or expand on an existing lab assignment, or even develop your own project. 

Project deliverable and timeline are:
*	Project proposal: 1 page or ~500 words. Due week 7
*	Project Report: Due Week 15
* 	Poster submission: Week 15
* 	Project presentation: Weeks 16-17

The details of project topics, requirements, and deliverables are described in the lecture slides.

### Attendance and participation
The standard university guidelines apply, as you might imagine. However, I will repeat some of the essential “rules” for a successful course.  Be respectful to the instructor and fellow students.  Participation in class activities will be noted and will influence your final grade.  The following are never acceptable in class: chronic tardiness, talking out of turn, sleeping, reading non-class material, CELL PHONE USE, emailing or text messaging, and disruptive behavior.  You are responsible to make up missed information or work on your own time if absent or late.  Cheating of any type, on labs or exams will result in a zero for the work and a referral to appropriate school authorities.  This is a “learning through doing” course and you can only succeed through your own personal application.  

To that end, **unexcused absences of 5 or more will result in a failing grade for the course.**  You must communicate with your instructor if you know you will be absent.  Documentation for the absence may be required in order to be “excused.”  

If you have any challenges to learning and need support of any kind, you are invited to contract your instructor or the Kokua Center for assistance or questions.
